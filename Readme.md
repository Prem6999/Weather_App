# Welcome everybody to the readme file of this project
Let get to the business directly 
to implement the project completely you need to follow the steps below:-

Moreover to clone my repo you need to use the code git "Link of my repo".git

1. create a virtual environment in your IDE using the code:
 
    For Windows :- 
 
         python -m venv env

    For Mac :-

        python3 -m venv env

2. Change the directory to the virtual environment:
    
    cd env

3. Activate the virtual environment:

    For Windows :-

    env\Scripts\activate

    For Mac :-
    source env/bin/activate

Now you have successfully created a virtual environment

Now let's move towards the main thing implementing the project and to do so we are going to install some required modules and I already stored that modules in the requirements.txt file so we are just going to install that module using the code in the terminal the code is given below:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Now you have successfully installed all the required modules
These are resolved by the included `.pylintrc` and `.vscode/settings.json` files.  
No manual setup is needed â€” just open the project in VS Code and make sure the Python virtual environment is activated.

And after that in the main.py file you need there is a string assigned as api_key where you need to put your api key from this link :- [Link](https://openweathermap.org/api) after signing up in that website you need to click on your profile you'll see My API keys in the dropdown click and there you go your API key and you need to put that in the api_key string.
